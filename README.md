# xmlmetadata

* XML schema for Dakoda metadaten.
* The xml schema version employed here is 1.1. because we use assertions for checking constraints in the data. ( A command line tool to validate against xsd 1.1. is `https://github.com/jeszy75/xsd11-validator`)
* There  is html  documentation for the schema available in the html folder.
* The python code to generate xml file is based on `xsdata`.
